            <hr>
            <p>Hello there, I'm Kick van den Boom, a 18-year-old software developer with a passion for crafting unique and stylized games with abstract art styles. I believe that in the world of game development, creativity knows no boundaries, and I love pushing those boundaries to create immersive experiences for players. My work seeks to challenge conventions, engage players, and transport them into imaginative, thought-provoking worlds. Whether it's through surreal landscapes, vibrant colors, or intricate design, I strive to leave a lasting impression through my games.
                Outside of the digital realm, I'm also a hobbyist electronic music producer. Crafting melodies, experimenting with sounds, and creating electronic soundscapes is another way I express my creativity. My love for music often intersects with my game development, as I believe that audio is an essential element in enhancing the overall gaming experience.</p>

            <h2>Goldfish Dreams</h2>
            <p>Goldfish Dreams is a game made in three days for a game jam using C# and the Unity engine. Its a fast paced top down shooter where you play as a goldfish who has the ability to take over and control human bodies, this is turned into a mechanic where the player has to keep switching between bodies to keep shooting, because a goldfish cannot reload.
            </p>
            <img src="img/fish1.gif" width="400px" height="200px" alt="gif that shows the body switching mechanic of Goldfish Dreams.">
            <p>Goldfish dreams has 6 unique levels, 3 enemy and weapon types, the ability to loop after completion and tons of different upgrades to ensure that no run plays the same.</p>
            <img src="img/fish2.gif" width="400px" height="200px" alt="gif that shows a Goldfish Dreams level being played.">
            <p>The gameplay feels extremely fast paced, precise and very polished which is why shortly after development, we decided to publish Goldfish dreams to our itch.io page, which lead to acclaim from our friends, teachers (many of which have worked in Game Design before) and even a total of 6 euros in profit.</p>

            <h2>QORST: Quintesentially Obscure and Ruthlessly Spelled terms</h2>
            <p>QORST is a game made by 4 developers in 4 days, without communication. Throughout the development we passed the game around day by day, each developer only got 1 day to work on the game, i was third.</p>
            <img src="img/Qorst.gif" width="400px" height="200px" alt="gif that showcases the main gameplay loop of QORST">
            <p>I ended up adding quite a bit of features, including powerups and camera rotation, aswell as reworking some features that were already added. <br> QORST turned out as an extremely fast-paced third person spelling game, where the player has to choose the correct word out three options all while destroying incoming meteorites..</p>

            <h2>Pheatthph</h2>
            <p>Pheatthph is a collaborative project between me and 2 other friends, its a work in progress first person walking simulator with a heavy focus on atmosphere and exploration currently being developed in the Unity engine I worked on physics and the prop grabbing system.<br>
            </p>
            <img src="img/fet1.gif" width="400px" height="200px" alt="Gif that shows the graphics of the Pheatthph game.">
            <p>Its graphical style is inspired by early Playstation games, so to give it the look we wanted we made sure to use textures of the same resolution you would find in an early Playstaion game, aswell as post processing effects to scale the game down to 320 x 180, which gave us the look we wanted.<br>
            </p>
            <img src="img/fet2.gif" width="400px" height="200px" alt="gif that shows slope movement in the Pheatthph game">
            <p>Working on Pheatthph tought me alot about making good stylized graphics using post processing, as it was one of the first games i made where i could see the general style and atmosphere really working out. I also worked alot on the physics props and making a system that allows you to pick them up and throw them.
